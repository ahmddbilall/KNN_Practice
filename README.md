# KNN_Practice

In this model, I practiced to implement KNN on a very useless data set. There was no connection in columns also the problem was not identified. I randomly selected one column to be Output.

Although model accuracy is very bad, but while training this model I had a great experience in EDA. First time performed EDA on a dataset without any guidance.
